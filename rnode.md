# RNode

Since Rnode 0.2.1, three mode of operations exist :

- REPL mode — Allows users to execute Rholang code at the command line. This is a read, evaluate, and print loop (REPL). The Rholang tutorial — 0.2 will help you get started with Rholang while operating RNode in REPL mode.
- EVAL mode — Allows users to pass in Rholang code stored in a text file with the extension .RHO.
- P2P mode (default) — Allows users to stand up a node that connects to other nodes in the RChain network.

Full details on operating the node in these modes is described in the [documentation](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/blob/master/node/README.md).
