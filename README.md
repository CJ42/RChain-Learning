# RChain-Learning
Learning group for the RChain platform

Rho-Lang :

- concurrent computational system
- Intelligent concurrency
- based on Rho-calculus innovation
- Reflective Higher Order Calculus (Rho Calculus)

Namespaces = 

- virtual groups of RNodes within the networks (can be customized for specific parameters)
- virtual channels on the network, independently and concurrently processing transactions

Next generation sharding divides the network into optimize pieces = eliminate races conditions

Every namespace, process and transaction is inspected and formally verified before executing
Built-in privacy tools

Current systems are constrained by the single chain problem :
Sequential computing inevitably limits scalability and speed + increases transaction costs.
