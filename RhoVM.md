# Rho Virtual Machine (RhoVM)

The Rho Virtual Machine, abbreviated as **RhoVM** is built in Scala and Java. This virtual machine is based on the Rosette system (Rosette Virtual Machine), which has been in commercial production since 1994 in Automated Teller Machines.

The RhoVM Execution Environment runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
The individual RhoVM instances run within the RhoVM Execution Environment.

The RhoVM Execution Environment provides the context for contract execution, the lifecycle of individual RhoVM instances.

The chart below describes the flow of the compiler into bytecode.
